- [x] Use DataFrames.jl to perform data retrieval, selection and plot
- [ ] Time efficient code: write on file every x times, with x reasonably large
- [x] Implement automatic safecopy of data
- [x] Employ symmetry: many calculations are just pure repetitions
- [x] Use normalized K
- [x] Re-use previous value in step for fast convergence
- [x] Restrict to MBZ calculation AND CHECK MULTIPLIERS!
- [ ] Insert graphs in report
